![Titanic](https://github.com/Cef777/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-05-23%20204012.png)

## 📘 Overview

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the well-known [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset/data). The primary goal is to explore factors that influenced passenger survival during the RMS Titanic disaster in 1912 using statistical and graphical EDA techniques.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Apply EDA techniques to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- Investigate the relationship between passenger attributes (e.g., class, gender, age) and survival outcomes.
- Develop insights that can guide future predictive modeling tasks.

## 📂 Dataset Summary

| Attribute        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `PassengerId`    | Unique ID for each passenger |
| `Survived`       | Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| `Pclass`         | Passenger Class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) |
| `Name`           | Name of the passenger |
| `Sex`            | Gender |
| `Age`            | Age in years |
| `SibSp`          | Siblings/Spouses aboard |
| `Parch`          | Parents/Children aboard |
| `Ticket`         | Ticket number |
| `Fare`           | Passenger fare |
| `Cabin`          | Cabin number |
| `Embarked`       | Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Passenger Class:** 1st Class passengers had the highest survival rates.
- **Gender:** Females had significantly higher survival odds than males.
- **Age:** Children under 16 had a better chance of survival, particularly in higher classes.
- **Fare:** Higher fares (typically paid by upper-class passengers) slightly correlated with survival.
- **Family:** No strong survival correlation found based on family traveling with passengers (SibSp/Parch).

---

## 📌 Conclusions

- Socioeconomic status played a significant role in survival.
- Gender and age were strong survival indicators, consistent with "women and children first."
- These insights can be foundational for predictive modeling.

---

## 💡 Recommendations for Future Work

- Investigate engineered features like `Deck` and `Title` (from `Name`).
- Explore non-linear models to capture complex interactions.
- Apply machine learning to test predictive performance.
